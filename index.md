# Intro

I am a first-year PhD candidate at the [Flowers Laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) of ENSTA ParisTech and INRIA (supervised by [David Filliat](http://perso.ensta-paristech.fr/~filliat/fr/)) and Softbank Robotics Europe (supervised by [Michaël Garcia-Ortiz](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Garcia_Ortiz)), enrolled in a CIFRE contract. 

# Research

My research focuses on Machine Learning. In my PhD, I study model-based approaches for Reinforcement Learning. It involves Developmental Robotics and Computer Vision.

# Background

My love for Mathematics has always led my journey through education. First I was at Télécom SudParis, an engineering school centered around the fields of new technologies, telecommunication and applied mathematics. Then I was accepted in the double degree between Télécom SudParis and ENSAE ParisTech, one the top french engineering school in Data Science. I worked out my way to the top students of ENSAE, and was accepted in another double diploma, at one the most selective master's degree of France in Machine Learning : the MVA master's degree at ENS Cachan. I graduated with honors from these three institutions.

I had the chance to work on several Machine Learning projects, as a research intern or a student, and code in many languages such as Python, R, JAVA. I think I qualify as an adaptative person, both socially (getting along with people) and at work (research or operational work).
